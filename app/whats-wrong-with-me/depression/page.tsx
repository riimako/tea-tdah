       DEPRESSION IS YOUR BODY SAYING
PFF, I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS CHARACTER ANY MORE, THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR me
i don't want to hold on this avatar
your body needs to be depressed

why i am tired?
if i leave the torch on, it will drain the energy of your phone
that's what anxiety does to you,
and that's why you don't have energy for other things
